## 1. Preface
SOChedule is a one-stop solution for managing tasks and events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  

The Developer Guide for Sochedule is designed to showcase the high level architecture systems used to design and implement Sochedule.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_task 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `SocheduleParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task or an event).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_task 1")` API call.

The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser`should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

### 3.4 Model component

This section explains the high level design of the `Model` component of our application.

The `Model` stores:
* a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* the Sochedule data.

There are two main packages in `Model`:
* the `Task` package contains classes that represent a task.
* the  `Event` package contains classes that represent an event.

Also, the `Model`:
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>`that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Model` component. 
Due to size constraint, this diagram omitted the details of the `Task` and `Event` packages. 
For more information, please refer to the class diagrams for `Task` and `Event` at the later section.

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The class diagram below gives the design of the `Task` package.

![Structure of the Task Package](images/TaskClassDiagram.png)

The class diagram below gives the design of the `Event` package.

![Structure of the Event Package](images/EventClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
**Note:** An (arguably) more OOP model can store a `Tag` list and a `Category` list in the `Sochedule`, which `Task` and `Event` can refer.
This allows `Sochedule` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, and one `Category` object per unique `Object`, 
instead of each `Task` and `Event` needing their own `Tag` and `Category` object.<br>

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.4.1 Design considerations for Task-related Models
When implementing Task-related models, it is important to avoid adding duplicate tasks. 
For example, it is undesirable for users to add the same task, completing CS2103 Quiz before 2021-06-01, twice into the task list. 
Because these two tasks contain the same information and can potentially cause confusion for users 
when he completes one and finds another task with the same description still left uncompleted.

In our application, we require users to minimally provide the name, deadline and priority when creating a task.
To ensure duplicates are handled, our team went through several alternatives and here are our considerations.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) </th>
        <th> Alternative 2 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li> isSameTask(Task task) method should check if the name, priority, deadline, tags (if any) and categories (if any) are equal.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tasks with same name but different deadline, priority and/or any other fields are allowed.</li>
                        <li>Similarly, tasks with same name, deadline and priority, but different tags and/or categories are allowed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Harder to implement.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li>isSameTask(Task task) method should check for the equality of task name only.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easier to implement.</li>
                        <li>Ensure that the task names are always distinct.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less flexibility and may not meet some users' need because task with same name but other different fields are not allowed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

We chose Alternative 1 because it is more flexible and suitable for users' need. 
There can be multiple tasks with same name but other different fields, like deadlines. 
For example, a user may need to create two tasks with the same name `2103 quiz`,
but one is due on this Monday and the other is due the next Monday. Both of these 2 tasks should be allowed in our task list.
Another example can be that a user may want to create two tasks with the same name `quiz`, deadline `2022-01-01` 
and priority `3`, but one is with tag `CS2103` and the other one is with tag `CS2102`. 
Both of these 2 tasks should be allowed in our task list.

#### 3.4.2 Design considerations for Event-related Models
Similar to Task-related Models, we face the same challenge when choosing between checking for the equality of name only and 
checking for all fields entered by the user. We chose to check for all fields for the same reasons as mentioned above.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.4.3 Design considerations for `Name` Object
When implementing the Name class, one of the considerations we need to decide is about its maximum length. 
Due to constraints in GUI, if the task or event has an extremely long name, only part of the name can be displayed,
and the rest will be hidden and cannot be viewed. This is something undesirable.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) </th>
        <th> Alternative 2 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li> Set the maximum length to 30 characters long.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resolved the potential bug where tasks or events with excessively long names are displayed incompletely.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li> More restrictive as a hard maximum limit has been set to disallow users from creating a task or event with a name of longer than 30 characters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li>Do not set a maximum length and find other potential solutions.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users can have more freedom in creating or editing the tasks and events.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>May require major changes to the design and implementation of GUI, which may be time consuming and lead to other undesirable bugs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

We chose Alternative 1 because this is the most suitable option given the limited development time 
and more controllable impacts on other components of the application. More importantly, we estimate that 
the current maximum length is sufficient to meet most of our users' common needs. 
Thus, under normal usage, this additional restrictions will not cause great inconveniences to our users.

#### 3.4.3 Design considerations for `Tag` and `Category` Object
Similar to `Name` Object, we face the same challenge when displaying tasks or events with tags and categories
of excessively long length. 
We choose to set the maximum length to 15 characters long for the similar reasons as mentioned above.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Sochedule data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

Classes used by both `Task` and `Event` are in the `seedu.address.model.common` package.

## 4 Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how [SOChedule](#41-sochedule), [Task](#42-task) and [Event](#43-event) are implemented.

### 4.1 SOChedule

#### 4.1.1 Overview

SOChedule consists of two lists: a task list and an event list. The task list is used to accommodate different tasks
specified by users while the event list is used to accommodate different events specified by users.

While both task list and event list can be updated independently by their corresponding commands (e.g. `add_task`, 
`delete_event`), there are some SOChedule-Level commands listed as follows that can act on both task list and event list:

* [`clear`](#implementation-of-clear-command)
* [`summary`](#implementation-of-summary-command)
* [`find_schedule`](#implementation-of-find_schedule-command)

#### 4.1.2 Implementation of SOChedule-Level Commands

#### Implementation of `clear` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `clear` command is laid out in [`ClearCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ClearCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `ClearCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear` command to clear task and event lists.
An `ClearCommandParser` object is created, and the `ClearCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
A `ClearCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearCommand#execute()`, `Model#setSochedule(new Sochedule())` is called.
This will replace Sochedule data with a new empty Sochedule.
For brevity, lower level implementation is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for `ClearCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of Clear Command](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Overview](#411-overview)


#### Implementation of `summary` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `summary` command is laid out in [`SummaryCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SummaryCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `SummaryCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `summary` command to get a summary of the current completion status of tasks and events.
An `SummaryCommandParser` object is created, and the `SummaryCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
A `SummaryCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: In `SummaryCommand#execute()`, the following methods care called to get different statistics on task and event completion:
* `Model#getNumCompletedTask()`
* `Model#getFilteredTaskList()`
* `Model#getNumOverdueTask()`
* `Model#getNumIncompleteTask()`
* `Model#getNumIncomingEvents()` <br>
For brevity, lower level implementation is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for `SummaryCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of Summary Command](images/SummaryCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

[Return to Overview](#411-overview)  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of `find_schedule` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `find_schedule` command is laid out in [`FindScheduleCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindScheduleCommand.java)
The find schedule mechanism is supported mainly by `FindScheduleCommand` and `FindScheduleCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `FindScheduleCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into a Date object.
* `FindScheduleCommand#execute(Model model)` - Finds the uncompleted tasks with deadlines before or on the specified date and
events with start date before or on and end date after or on the specified date.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `find_schedule 2021-04-01` command to find the ongoing tasks and events before or on the given date.
An `FindScheduleCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindScheduleCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses the `2021-04-01` and conducts validation checks.
Two predicates, `TaskFindSchedulePredicate(Date date)` and `EventFindSchedulePredicate(Date date)` are created based on the given date.
Then, a `FindScheduleCommand` object is created given the two predicates and returned.

**Step 2**: On `FindScheduleCommand#execute()`, 
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)` 
and `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)` are called.
This will update the task list to only show the uncompleted tasks with the deadline before or on the given date.
Similarly, the event list will be updated to only show the events with start date before or on the given date and end date after or on the given date.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)` 
and `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)` are omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_FIND_SCHEDULE_SUCCESS`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for a sample usage of `FindScheduleCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of FindSchedule Command](images/FindScheduleCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
Due to the size constraint and brevity, the argument `taskPredicate` is not shown in the sequence diagram 
when calling the method `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(TaskFindSchedulePredicate taskPredicate)`.
Same for the method `Model#updateFilteredEventList(EventFindSchedulePredicate eventPredicate)`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design Considerations**

The purpose of find schedule is to find and show our users the list of tasks and events that are worth to be paid
attention to at the specified date. 

For events, it is clear that events which have not started at the given date (i.e. start date
is before the given date) and events which have ended before the given date (i.e. end date is earlier than the given date)
should not be selected. This leads to only finding events that are ongoing at the specified date 
(i.e. with start date before or on and end date after or on the specified date). 

For tasks, it is debatable. Completed tasks should not shown. However, some
consideration is needed to determine which uncompleted tasks to display.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) </th>
        <th> Alternative 2 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li> Select uncompleted tasks with deadlines before or on the given date.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less tasks are being shown. This may be more helpful as users can focus more on these tasks with an earlier deadline than the other tasks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li> More restrictive and less tasks being shown also means that less information may be provided to users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li>Select all existing uncompleted tasks.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>More tasks are being shown and presented to users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The date provided is not adding useful value here and users may find this implementation less helpful.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Alternative 1 is chosen because we believe this implementation can make better use of the date provided and can be more

### 4.2 Task

#### 4.2.1 Overview

`Task` is a type of activity that comes with a `Deadline` attribute and can be marked as complete or uncompleted. It is
specified by the following attributes:

* `Name`
* `Deadline`
* `Priority`
* `[Category] ...` (Optional, can be multiple)
* `[Tag] ...` (Optional, can be multiple)

Note that a `Task` is defined to be the same as another `Task` if and only if all of their attributes listed above are
equal correspondingly.

Our `Task` supports the following features through a `LogicManager`.

* [`add_task`](#implementation-of-add_task-command)
* [`delete_task`](#implementation-of-delete_task-command)
* [`edit_task`](#implementation-of-edit_task-command)
* `list_task` (Omitted for brevity and simplicity)
* [`done_task`](#implementation-of-done_task-command)
* [`undone_task`](#implementation-of-undone_task-command)
* [`today_task`](#implementation-of-today_task-command)
* [`find_task`](#implementation-of-find_task-command)
* [`sort_task`](#implementation-of-sort_task-command)
* [`pin_task`/`unpin_task`](#implementation-of-pin_taskunpin_task-commands)
* [`clear_completed_task`](#implementation-of-clear_completed_task-command)
* [`clear_expired_task`](#implementation-of-clear_expired_task-command)

:information_source: **Note:**

The implementation of the noteworthy ones will be listed in the next section.
Some implementations of features are omitted because their implementation is similar to that of other features.

#### 4.2.2 Implementation of Task-level commands

#### Implementation of `add_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `add_task` command is laid out in [`AddTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddTaskCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `AddTaskCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step1**: User executes `add_task n/TASKNAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...` command to add the 
specific task with given arguments. An `AddTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the 
`AddTaskParser#parse(String args)` method is called. The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation
checks to ensure that it compiles with the specification. An `AddTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `AddTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#addTask(Task taskToAdd)` is called.
This will add the task specified into the task list.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#addTask(Task taskToAdd)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_ADD_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `AddTaskCommand` can be found below.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of `delete_task` command  
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `delete_task` command is laid out in [`DeleteTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteTaskCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `DeleteTaskCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `delete_task INDEX` command to delete the task at the given index.
A `DeleteTaskParser` object is created, and the `DeleteTaskParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `INDEX` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `DeleteTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `DeleteTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#deleteTask(Task taskToDelete)` is called.
This will delete the task at the specified index.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#deleteTask(Task taskToDelete)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_DELETE_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `DeleteTaskCommand` can be found below.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of `edit_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `edit_task` command is laid out in [`EditTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditTaskCommand.java)
The edit task mechanism is supported mainly by `EditTaskCommand` and `EditTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `EditTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input arguments.
* `EditTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Edits the task at the specified index and updates its respective
  values with the supplied values.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `edit_task 1 n/t1` command to Edit the task at the given index.
An `EditTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `EditTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses the `1 n/t1` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
An `EditTaskDescriptor` object is created, and it contains all the field a task needed.
If the field is edited, then store the edited one; otherwise, store the original value.
An `EditTaskCommand` object (with the `EditTaskDescriptor` as a parameter) is returned.

**Step 2**: On `EditTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` and
`Model#createEditedTask(Task taskToEdit, EditTaskDescriptor editTaskDescriptor)` are called.
These will create the edited Task. Then, `Model#setTask(Task taskToEdit, Task editedTask)` and
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` are called. These will update the edited Task into the task list.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `EditTaskCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for a sample usage of `EditTaskCommand` can be found below.

![Sequence Diagram of EditTask Command](images/EditTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations**

One of the challenges is if we should allow overdue tasks (task with deadlines before today) to be edited.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Alternative 1 (Chosen Implementation) </th>
        <th> Alternative 2 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li> Overdue tasks can be edited. </li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Users may need to edit an overdue task frequently to extend the deadline of an overdue task. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Users may not want overdue tasks to be edited.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> 
            <ul>
                <li>Overdue tasks cannot be edited.</li>
                <li> Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>May satisfy the demand of users as described in cons of alternative 1.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>May not meet the requirements of users as described in pros of alternative 1.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


Alternative 1 is chosen because we believe this implementation is a more suitable choice given our users' need at
normal usage. Furthermore, if users wish to their overall progress for this week, they may choose to act with caution before
editing a task or editing it back quickly if they realize they have edited the wrong task.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of `done_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `done_task` command is laid out in [`DoneTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DoneTaskCommand.java)
The done task mechanism is supported mainly by `DoneTaskCommand` and `DoneTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into one or more Index objects.
* `DoneTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Marks the tasks at the given indexes as completed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the done task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `done_task 1 2`.
These tasks will be known as target tasks.
A `DoneTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `DoneTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses `1 2` and conducts validation checks to ensure that the given indexes are all valid unsigned non-zero integers.
A `DoneTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `DoneTaskCommand#execute()`, 
the indices are further checked to ensure the target tasks exist in the task list and they are not completed.
Afterwards, the information of the target tasks are copied and completed tasks with exactly the same information as the target tasks are created.
Finally, `Model#setTask(Task taskToDone, Task completedTask)` are called two times to update the respective target tasks in the task list.
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` method is called to refresh the UI and show the update.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#setTask(Task taskToDone, Task completedTask)`, 
and `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` are omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_DONE_TASK_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for a sample usage of `DoneTaskCommand`can be found below, using the aforementioned as an example.

![Sequence Diagram of DoneTask Command](images/DoneTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** 
Due to the size constraint, the argument `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS` is not shown in the sequence diagram 
when calling the method `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)`.

</div>

**Design Considerations**

One of the challenges is if we should add additional support to allow done task command to mark more than one tasks as completed.
Here are our considerations.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Users may frequently need to mark multiple tasks as completed, thus saving a significant amount of time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>More time-consuming to implement.</li>
                        <li>Additional ifficulty in testing and integration with other commands and components.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Alternative 2 is chosen because we believe this implementation is a more suitable choice. 
Unlike `undone_task`, users are likely to have the demand to mark multiple tasks as complete
under normal usage. Thus, we feel alternative 2 is necessary to serve our users efficiently.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation of `undone_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `undone_task` command is laid out in [`UndoneTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoneTaskCommand.java)
The undone task mechanism is supported mainly by `UndoneTaskCommand` and `UndoneTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `UndoneTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into an Index object.
* `UndoneTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Marks the task at the given index as uncompleted.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undone task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `undone_task 1` command to mark the completed task at the given index as uncompleted. 
This task will be known as the target task.
An `UndoneTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `UndoneTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses the `1` and conducts validation checks to ensure that the given index is a valid unsigned non-zero integer.
An `UndoneTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `UndoneTaskCommand#execute()`,
the indices are further checked to ensure the target task exist in the task list, and they are not uncompleted to begin with.
Afterwards, the information of the target task is copied, and an uncompleted task with exactly the same information as the target task is created.
Finally, `Model#setTask(Task taskToUndone, Task uncompletedTask)` and `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` method are called.
These two methods update the target task in the task list and refresh the UI to show the update.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#setTask(Task taskToUndone, Task uncompletedTask)` 
and `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS)` are omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_UNDONE_TASK_SUCCESS`.

The sequence diagram for a sample usage of `UndoneTaskCommand` can be found below, using the aforementioned as an example.

            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Alternative 1 is chosen because we believe this implementation is a more suitable choice given the limited development and
testing time. More importantly, unlike `done_task`, users are unlikely to have the demand to mark multiple tasks as uncompleted at one go
under normal usage. Thus, we feel alternative 1 is sufficient to serve our users.

#### Implementation of `today_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `today_task` command is laid out in [`TodayTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/TodayTaskCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `TodayTaskCommand.java` is implemented.

The TodayTaskCommand is supported mainly by `TodayTaskCommand`.

The relevant methods include:
* `TodayTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Updates the task list on UI to show all the tasks that has deadline on 
  today which are stored in the internal task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `today_task` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `today_task` command to list all the tasks with deadline on today in the task list.
A `TodayTaskCommand` object is returned

**Step 2**: On `TodayTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` is called. This 
will update the filtered task list with the predicate specified by the input predicate, which is a predicate of type
`TaskDeadlineIsTodayPredicate`. For brevity, lower level implementation of 
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion, a `CommandResult` is created. A success message will be appended with
`CommandResult#MESSAGE_TODAY_TASK_SUCCESS` and `MESSAGE_TASK_LISTED_OVERVIEW`. The UI will also update as the underlying 
task list that has been modified.

The sequence diagram for TodayTaskCommand can be found below.

#### Implementation of `find_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `find_task` command is laid out in [`FindTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindTaskCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `FindTaskCommand.java` is implemented.

The FindTaskCommand is supported mainly by `FindTaskCommand` and `FindTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `FindTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into a list of keywords.
* `FindTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Updates the task list on UI to show all the tasks whose names contain any of 
  the given keywords from the internal task list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find task mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `find_task homework assignment` to find all tasks whose names contain any of `homework` or 
`assignment`.
These tasks will be known as the target tasks.
A `FindTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses the `homework assignment` into a list of strings : [`homwork`, `assignment`], which is the original
string delimited using whitespace. This list of strings will be passed into the constructor of 
`TaskNameContainsKeywordPredicate`, which will then be passed into the constucter of `FindTaskCommand`.
The `FindTaskCommand` object with input predicate is returned.

**Step 2**:
On `FindTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` is called. This
will update the filtered task list with the predicate specified by the input predicate, which is a predicate of type
`TaskNameContainsKeywordPredicate`. For brevity, lower level implementation of
`Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_TASKS_LISTED_OVERVIEW`.

The sequence diagram for `FindTaskCommand` can be found below, using `find_task hw1` as an example.

#### Implementation of `sort_task` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `sort_task` command is laid out in [`SortTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortTaskCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `SortTaskCommand.java` is implemented in the Logic component.

The SortTaskCommand is supported mainly by `SortTaskCommand` and `SortTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `SortTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into a list of keywords.
* `SortTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Updates the task list on UI to based on the `ARGUMENT` given.
  
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort task mechanism behaves at each step, using `sort_task name` as an example.

**Step 1**: User executes `sort_task name` command to sort the tasks based on the `SORT_VAR` provided.
An `SortTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `SortTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called. 
The method conducts parses `name` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `SortTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `SortTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#sortTasks(String comparingVar)` is called.
This will cause the task list to sort itself, based on the provided `comparingVar` (`name`, in this case).
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#sortTasks(String comparingVar)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_SORT_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `sortTaskCommand` can be found below, using the aforementioned as an example.

Our group decided to go with alternative 1 and implemented an additional sort comparator known as `TaskComparator`.
This is to ensure smoother UX, as well as better integration with other commands.

By implementing it in this way, our group is able to ensure that the sort order remains consistent over commands that could either:
* Alter the number of tasks shown at any one time (See `find_task`)
* Change the order of task appearance independent of `sort_task` (See `pin_task`)

This would enable SOChedule to better serve the needs of its user base.

#### Implementation of `pin_task`/`unpin_task` commands
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `pin_task` command is laid out in [`PinTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/PinTaskCommand.java),
while the governing logic behind `unpin_task` command is laid out in [`UnpinTaskCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UnpinTaskCommand.java)

The following is a detailed explanation on how `PinTaskCommand.java` is implemented.
Since UnpinTaskCommand is largely similar in implementation to PinTaskCommand, it will be omitted for brevity.

The PinTaskCommand is supported mainly by `PinTaskCommand` and `PinTaskCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `PinTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into a given `INDEX`.
* `PinTaskCommand#execute(Model model)` - Marks target task as pinned, and updates the UI accordingly.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin task mechanism behaves at each step, using `pin_task 1` as an example.

**Step 1**: User executes `pin_task 1` command to pin the task at the given index.
An `PinTaskCommandParser` object is created, and the `PinTaskCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses `1` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `PinTaskCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `PinTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#pinTask(Task task)` is called.
This will pin the task at the specified index.
Subsequently, the underlying task list will be sorted by calling `Model#sortTasksDefault()`, with pinned tasks being first in priority, followed by the last argument used for sorting 
(if `sort_task` was not called before, task list will be sorted by name).
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#pinTask(Task task)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_PIN_TASK_SUCCESS`.
The UI will also update as the underlying task list has been modified.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for `PinTaskCommand` can be found below.
It is largely similar to `SortTaskCommand`, with a some minor differences:
* Instead of `SortTask`-related parsers and commands, `PinTask`-related parsers and commands are created and activated.
* Additional call to `Model#sortTasksDefault()` after `Model#pinTask(Task)`

The below activity diagram summarises what happens when `pin_task` is called, using `pin_task 1` as an example.

The following is a detailed explanation on how ClearCompletedTaskCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear_completed_task` command to clear completed tasks in task list.
A `ClearCompletedTaskCommand` object is created and returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearCompletedTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#clearCompletedTasks()` is called.
This will delete all ticked tasks (all completed tasks).
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#clearCompletedTasks()` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `ClearCompletedTaskCommand#MESSAGE_CLEAR_COMPLETED_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

The following is a detailed explanation on how `ClearExpiredTaskCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear_expired_task` command to clear expired tasks in task list.
A `ClearExpiredTaskCommand` object is created and returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearExpiredTaskCommand#execute()`, `Model#clearExpiredTasks()` is called.
This will delete all expired tasks whose deadlines have already passed.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#clearExpiredTasks()` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `ClearExpiredTaskCommand#MESSAGE_CLEAR_EXPIRED_TASK_SUCCESS` will be displayed.

### 4.3 Event

#### 4.3.1 Overview

`Event` is a type of activity that has a specific `StartDate` and `StartTime` following an `EndDate` and `EndTime`.
It is specified by the following attributes:

* `Name`
* `StartDate`
* `StartTime`
* `EndDate`
* `EndTime`
* `[Category] ...` (Optional, can be multiple)
* `[Tag] ...` (Optional, can be multiple)

Note that an `Event` is defined to be the same as another `Event` if and only if all of their attributes listed above 
are equal correspondingly.

Our `Event` supports the following features through a `LogicManager`

* [`add_event`](#implementation-of-add_event-command)
* [`delete_event`](#implementation-of-delete_event-command)
* [`edit_event`](#implementation-of-edit_event-command)
* `list_event` (Omitted for brevity and simplicity)
* [`today_event`](#implementation-of-today_event-command)
* [`find_event`](#implementation-of-find_event-command)
* [`clear_expired_event`](#implementation-of-clear_expired_event-command)
* [`free_time`](#implementation-of-free_time-command)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

The implementation of the noteworthy ones will be listed in the next section.
Some implementations of features are omitted because their implementation is similar to that of other features.

#### 4.3.2 Implementation of Event-level commands

#### Implementation of `add_event` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `add_event` command is laid out in [`AddEventCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/AddEventCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how `AddEventCommand.java` is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `add_event n/TASKNAME sd/STARTDATE st/STARTTIME ed/ENDDATE et/ENDTIME [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]...` 
command to add the specific event with given arguments. An `AddEventCommandParser` object is created, and the 
`AddEventCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called. The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation
checks to ensure that it compiles with the specification. An `AddEventCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `AddEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#addEvent(Event eventToAdd)` is called.
This will add the event specified into the event list.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#addEvent(Event eventToAdd)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `AddEventCommand#MESSAGE_ADD_EVENT_SUCCESS` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

The sequence diagram for `AddEventCommand` can be found below.

The following is a detailed explanation on how DeleteEventCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `delete_event 1` command to delete the event at the given index.
A `DeleteEventCommandParser` object is created, and the `DeleteEventParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `1` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `DeleteEventCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `DeleteEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#deleteEvent(Event eventToDelete)` is called.
This will delete the event at the specified index.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#deleteEvent(Event eventToDelete)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `DeleteEventCommand#MESSAGE_DELETE_EVENT_SUCCESS` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

#### Implementation of `edit_event` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `edit_event` command is laid out in [`EditEventCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/EditEventCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how EditEventCommand is implemented.

The `edit_event` feature was implemented with a static class `EditEventDescriptor` introduced.

<img src="images/EditEventCommandClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

**Step 1**: User executes `edit_event 1 n/e1` command to Edit the event at the given index.
An `EditEventCommandParser` object is created, and the `EditEventCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `1 n/e1` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
An `EditEventDescriptor` object is created, and it contains all the field an Event needed.
If the field is edited, then store the edited one; otherwise, store the original value.
An `EditEventCommand` object (with the `EditEventDescriptor` as a parameter) is returned.

**Step 2**: On `EditEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFilteredEventList()` and
`Model#createEditedEvent(Event eventToEdit, EditEventDescriptor editEventDescriptor)` are called.
These will create the edited Event. Then, `Model#setEvent(Event eventToEdit, Event editedEvent)` and
`Model#updateFilteredEventList()` are called. These will update the edited Event into the event list.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message `EditEventCommand#MESSAGE_EDIT_EVENT_SUCCESS` will be displayed.
The UI will also update as the underlying event list has been modified.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram for `EditEventCommand` can be found below, using the aforementioned as an example.

We chose alternative 1 because when an event ends, it is meaningless to let users make changes
on any field other than end date and time. We did consider the fact that an event in the real world could be extended,
so we allow users to make changes on end date and time from an expired timestamp to an unexpired timestamp. Besides,
we allowed an expired task to be edited is because if the task is expired but not completed yet, it would then become
an “overdue task”, while there’s no “overdue event”.

#### Implementation of `today_event` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `today_event` command is laid out in [`TodayEventCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/TodayEventCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how TodayEventCommand is implemented.

The TodayEventCommand is supported mainly by `TodayEventCommand`.

The relevant methods include:
* `TodayEventCommand#execute(Model model)` - Updates the event list on UI to show all the events whose time duration has
  overlaps with today in the event list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `today_event` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `today_event` command to list all the events whose duration has overlap with today
in the event list.
A `TodayEventCommand` object is returned

**Step 2**: On `TodayEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Event> predicate)` is called. This
will update the filtered event list with the predicate specified by the input predicate, which is a predicate of type
`EventCoversTodayPredicate`. For brevity, lower level implementation of
`Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Event> predicate)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion, a `CommandResult` is created. A success message will be appended with
`CommandResult#MESSAGE_TODAY_EVENT_SUCCESS` and `MESSAGE_EVENT_LISTED_OVERVIEW`. The UI will also update as the underlying
event list that has been modified.

#### Implementation of `find_event` command
In SOChedule, the governing logic behind the `find_event` command is laid out in [`FindEventCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindEventCommand.java)
The following is a detailed explanation on how FindEventCommand is implemented.

The FindEventCommand is supported mainly by `FindEventCommand` and `FindEventCommandParser`.

The relevant methods include:
* `FindEventCommandParser#parse(String args)` - Parses the user input into a list of keywords.
* `FindEventCommand#execute(Model model)` - Updates the event list on UI to show all the events whose names contain any of
  the given keywords from the internal event list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find event mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: User executes `find_event project meeting` to find all events whose names contain any of `project` or
`meeting`.
Let us call these task the target tasks.
A `FindEventCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindEventCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method parses the `project meeting` into a list of strings : [`project`, `meeting`], which is the original
string splitted by whitespace. This list of strings will be passed into the constructor of
`EventNameContainsKeywordPredicate`, which will then be passed into the constuctor of a `FindEventCommand`.
The `FindEventCommand` object with input predicate is returned.

**Step 2**:
On `FindEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Event> predicate)` is called. This
will update the filtered event list with the predicate specified by the input predicate, which is a predicate of type
`EventNameContainsKeywordPredicate`. For brevity, lower level implementation of
`Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Eventk> predicate)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_EVENTS_LISTED_OVERVIEW`.

The sequence diagram for `FindEventCommand` can be found below, using `find_event meeting` as an example.

**Step 1**: User executes `clear_expired_event` command to clear expired events in the event list.
A `ClearExpiredEventCommand` object is created and returned.

**Step 2**: On `ClearExpiredEventCommand#execute()`, `Model#clearExpiredEvents()` is called.
This will delete all expired events whose end date time have already passed.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#clearExpiredEvents()` is omitted.

The following is a detailed explanation on how FindFreeTimeCommand is implemented.

**Step 1**: User executes `free_time DATE` command to find free time slots in the given day.
An `FindFreeTimeCommandParser` object is created, and the `FindFreeTimeCommandParser#parse(String args)` method is called.
The method conducts parses the `args` and conducts validation checks to ensure that it complies with the specification.
A `FindFreeTimeCommand` object is returned.

**Step 2**: On `FindFreeTimeCommand#execute()`, `Model#getFreeTimeSlots(Date date)` is called.
This will get free time slots and store in a string arraylist.
For brevity, lower level implementation of `Model#getFreeTimeSlots(Date date)` is omitted.

**Step 3**: On execution completion a `CommandResult` is created.
A success message will be appended with `CommandResult#MESSAGE_FIND_FREE_TIME_SUCCESS`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### A8. Effort
Creating SOChedule took considerable effort and required significant effort from all members.
To achieve this, all members committed to meticulous planning, regular team meetings, effective communication
and strong collaboration to ensure that SOChedule is delivered on time and in a satisfactory state.

#### Major Changes

The original code base, Address Book 3 (AB3), was an application that was based around contacts management.
SOChedule, on the other hand, is an application that aims to help NUS School of Computing (SoC) students
to effectively manage their tasks and events.
As such, much changes had to be made to the original code base to ensure that the code is conducive for SOChedule.

* Major components had to be rewritten or adapted to suit SOChedule's needs.
  This includes `Model`, `Logic`, `UI`, `Storage`, among other smaller components.
  This rewrite had to be completed prior to the development of additional features,
  and demanded significant time and effort similar to building the product from scratch. 

* Beyond storing a single object type, `Person` in AB3, SOChedule is a major upgrade as it is able to handle two radically different object types, namely `Task` and `Event`.
  This significantly increased the complexity of our project as most of AB3 code are no longer applicable for use in SOChedule.
  This would mean that additional time was required to plan out the new objects and attributes thoroughly before implementation could begin.
  Furthermore, some attributes required addition validation checks beyond a simple presence and alphanumeric check. 
  For instance, the date-related attributes in `Event` (i.e. `START_DATE` and `END_DATE`) required more thoughtful consideration as there were more specific requirements required, such as past date checks.
  Such considerations could also have knock-on consequences on other attributes within the same class (date-related attributes could affect the checks for time-related attributes).
  This would naturally increase the level of complexity of this project.`

* Additional, non-trivial UI modifications had to be made as well. Beyond simple changes to the aesthetics,
  changes were made to how the UI functioned. Originally, AB3 only required one `ListView` to handle a single `Person` class.
  As SOChedule contains 2 different classes, two `ListView` were required, each coming with their own interface to underlying code.
  Additional thought was required to ensure smooth integration with backend code and smooth user experience.

#### Challenges

* Due to the additional attributes, there were much more attribute handling and edge case considerations.
  As such, the planning phase was made much more complicated as there was a need for thorough consideration of the new classes and their corresponding attributes.
  Concurrently, we also had to make sure that the code we implemented adhered to well-known coding principles to ensure code quality.
  To solve this, we laid down the design requirements early on in the project and ensured that all members had a clear overview of each other's work and responsibilities.
  Throughout development, regular team meetings were held to keep each other up to date on each other's progress.
  With the open communication and frequent updates, we were able to help each other test and proofread.
  Should there be any deviation from the intended outcome, issues were quickly raised and squashed.
  Through this iterative process, SOChedule was refined.
  
* Due to the increase in complexity over AB3, there were also challenges faced throughout implementation.
  Some challenges included requiring a thorough understanding of the existing code base and component interactions, 
  being clear of the separation of concerns and the actual implementation of the new commands, while balancing this with the tight deadlines and other commitments.
  To solve this, we split the workload based on components, in order to ensure that every team member could be the local expert on a component,
  and by commands. With this setup, each team member was a jack of all trades, and master of one.
  This smoothened the development process greatly as there was a sense of ownership with each member's commands, while also having the ability to seek clarification on any particular component.

#### Conclusion
Overall, while being undeniably tough and demanding, our group managed to unite and push through the challenges we faced incrementally.
While the workload was relentless, the process was made much better and smoother through clear communications and careful planning.
This made the development process much more enjoyable, and has definitely turned all of us into a better software developer in more ways than one.
